It may be especially useful for project-oriented organizations. The tool can help in finding ways to improve existing product or service or develop the new one. The team goes through five clear steps:"

-   "Measure the existing process. As a result, the team comes up with a list of agreed CTQ (critical-to-success) factors. Obvious from the name of the step, these factors should be easily measurable.",
-   "Analyze the available information on current performance. How and why the current state is different from the desired state? This step is about understanding the gap you need to overcome and the root cause of this gap.",
-   "Improve / Design stage is the step when the team stops strategizing and starts acting. The idea is to assess the possible ways to overcome the gap defined in the previous step. Cost-benefit analysis should help to find the options that work best. Then the team should run an experiment or a pilot project to test the approach. Measuring the CTQs of the pilot is uber-important.",
-   "Control / Verify is the step most frequently overlooked. This is about making sure that the new process is cascaded throughout the relevant part of the organization. It implies a lot of communication to assure that the staff not involved in the development is embracing the process improvement. In case of development of the new process or product this stage is used to verify with the client that the outcome meets their needs."
